# Optimality -  Simple Constraint Testing

This is a *simple* python script developed to help my COGS200 class with questions related to Optimality Theory. 
Specifically: 
1. Constraint Violation Tables
2. Winner-Loser Tables
3. Stratum Constraint Rankings

# Current Features:
1. Constraint Violation Table
2. Winner-Loser Table (kinda broken... but it does work)

# Todo:
1. Add Stratum Constraint Rankings.
2. Clean up UI.
3. Add more constraints.

# How to install 
If you're an experienced Python and/or GitHub user you should know the drill.
For everyone else:
#### Step 1: Install Python 3.10 or later and install Git.
#### Step 2: Clone the repo.
Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the folder you'd like to download this project to. Then paste the following command:

> git clone https://github.com/FeedTheWalrus/Optimality.git 

#### Step 3: Install requirements.
> cd Optimality
> pip install -r requirements.txt 

Sometimes that doesn't work and you may need to run the command as a pip3 command:

> pip3 install -r requirements.txt

After that pip should install the required packages for this program.

#### Step 4: Run Program.
You can either run it from your preferred IDE such as VSCode, or while your terminal is still in the same directory run the following command:

> python opti_gui.py

Once again if that doesn't work try this alternative command:

> python3 opti_gui.py

#### Step 5: Enjoy.
It's certainly not finished yet, but it definitely sorta runs.
